# Release Please workflow
# Automates CHANGELOG generation and version releases based on Conventional Commits
# https://github.com/google-github-actions/release-please-action
#
# How it works:
# 1. Commit messages following Conventional Commits (feat:, fix:, etc.)
# 2. Release Please creates/updates a PR with CHANGELOG and version bump
# 3. Merging that PR creates a GitHub Release with tag
#
# Commit types:
#   feat:     → minor version bump (0.1.0 → 0.2.0)
#   fix:      → patch version bump (0.1.0 → 0.1.1)
#   feat!:    → major version bump (0.1.0 → 1.0.0)
#   chore:    → no release
#   docs:     → no release
#   style:    → no release
#   refactor: → no release
