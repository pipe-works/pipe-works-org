        <h2>Goblin Law #3 — "On Walking"</h2>
        <blockquote>
          <p>You do not learn to walk before you run.</p>
        </blockquote>

        <p>You flail. You lurch. You fall forward with enthusiasm and no plan.</p>
        <p>This is not failure. This is motion.</p>

        <p>
          Walking is not a beginner’s skill. Walking is what emerges after you have fallen often
          enough to recognise balance. Any system, project, or person that demands “walking” before
          flailing is lying about how learning works.
        </p>
        <p>
          They are mistaking
          <em>composure</em>
          for
          <em>competence</em>
          and
          <em>stillness</em>
          for
          <em>control</em>
          .
        </p>

        <h3>Corollary</h3>
        <p>Running too early produces injuries that are later mistaken for experience.</p>

        <h3>Marginal Note</h3>
        <p>Infants do not walk. They bounce violently until gravity negotiates.</p>
        <p>
          <em>
            This law exists to protect early motion, awkward prototypes, unfinished thinking, and
            people learning in public.

        <h2>Goblin Law #5 — "Raise the Fist"</h2>

        <p>
          A goblin never bows to silence, nor bends to those who would chain the song. When the hall
          is dark, the fist is raised, for
          <strong>solidarity</strong>
          , for
          <strong>movement</strong>
          , for
          <strong>defiance</strong>
          .
        </p>
        <p>
          It is not a hand for meddling (that’s Law #37’s warning), but a hand for saying:
          <strong>“we build together, we resist together.”</strong>
        </p>

        <h3>Corollary</h3>
        <p>
          If a goblin’s work does not carry a spark of resistance, then it is just tinkering, not
          craft.
        </p>
      </section>

      <section class="rule" id="law-6">
        <a href="#index" class="back-to-index">← Back to index</a>
        <h2>Goblin Law #6 — "The Rule of Rules"</h2>

        <p>
          Some laws live only in one burrow: about pipes, or pots, or trade. But when a law echoes
          across many halls, from mushrooms to markets, from code to chords, it must be carved into
          the
          <strong>Foundational Stones (1–19)</strong>
          .
        </p>

        <p>
          Thus the goblin lawbook stays lean and sly, not bloated with copies. One carving, many
          echoes. This keeps creativity uncrushed.
        </p>

        <h3>Corollary</h3>
        <p>If a law wears more than one hat, it belongs among the first nineteen.</p>
      </section>

      <section class="rule" id="law-7">
        <a href="#index" class="back-to-index">← Back to index</a>
        <h2>Goblin Law #7 — "No Fat Orcs"</h2>

        <p>
          A goblin, or a goblin’s work, must do
          <strong>one thing well, and only that</strong>
          . Catch, calculate, display, export, persist — but never all at once.
        </p>

        <p>
          A pot that tries to be a drum, a helmet, and a cooking pan ends up dented and burnt. Each
          piece, like each goblin, stays
          <strong>lean and fast</strong>
          , carrying just enough to fulfil its promise. The heavy lifting belongs to other goblins
          down the chain.
        </p>

        <p>Every Fat Orc slows the Bus.</p>

        <h3>Corollary</h3>
        <p>
          If you wouldn’t carve it on a single stone tablet, or carry it on your back up a mountain,
          it’s trying to do too much.
        </p>
      </section>

      <section class="rule" id="law-8">
        <a href="#index" class="back-to-index">← Back to index</a>
        <h2>Goblin Law #8 — "All Goblins Are Boundary Guards"</h2>

        <p>
          No goblin is excused from the edges. Every goblin meets the Outside — raw bytes, strangers
          at the gate, shifting weather. But the test is not in the meeting; it is in how swiftly
          and cleanly they pass the news to the
          <strong>Bus</strong>
          .
        </p>

        <p>
          Delay breeds drift. Hoarding breeds shadow. Side-channels breed chaos. The Bus must always
          be the
          <strong>first place the Outside is written down</strong>
          .
        </p>

        <h3>Corollary</h3>
        <p>If you don't hand it to the Bus, you've already failed your watch.</p>
      </section>

      <section class="rule" id="law-9">
        <a href="#index" class="back-to-index">← Back to index</a>
        <h2>Goblin Law #9 — "On Constraint"</h2>

        <blockquote>
          <p>
            Decide as little as possible,
            <br />
            as late as possible.
          </p>
        </blockquote>

        <p>Let pressure build.</p>
        <p>Let meaning arrive on foot.</p>

        <h3>Corollary</h3>
        <p>If you feel the urge to explain, you are probably collapsing the world.</p>
      </section>

      <section class="rule" id="law-13">
        <a href="#index" class="back-to-index">← Back to index</a>
        <h2>Goblin Law #13 — "Keep the Guest List Clean"</h2>

        <p>
          A goblin hall is only as orderly as its guest list. If every goblin scrawls their own
          marks, soon the page is torn and the ink smudged. So one scribe keeps the book, and all
          goblins read from it.
        </p>

        <p>
          Thus clans share a
          <strong>single, trusted record</strong>
          of who’s present, what’s owed, and what’s been played. Not a dozen half-scribbled ledgers,
          but one clean list that all can trust.
        </p>

        <h3>Corollary</h3>
        <p>If two goblins argue over “what’s in the book,” you need a cleaner list.</p>
      </section>

      <section class="rule" id="law-14">
        <a href="#index" class="back-to-index">← Back to index</a>
        <h2>Goblin Law #14 — "The Last Goblin Learns Quietly"</h2>

        <p>
          A goblin does not refuse new ways. They simply continue surviving with the old ones until
          the noise dies down.
        </p>

        <p>
          Many goblins adopt tools late, not from stubbornness, but because the old tool still feeds
          them. This is not senility. This is
          <strong>robust sufficiency</strong>
          .
        </p>

        <h3>Corollary</h3>
        <p>
          Late adoption reveals where the system failed to teach, not where the goblin failed to
          learn.
        </p>

        <h3>Marginal Note</h3>
        <p>Some goblins fight dragons for years before discovering the shield has a strap.</p>

        <h2>Goblin Law #15 — "You Don't Get to Pick Only the Nice Bits"</h2>

        <blockquote>
          <p>Every action carries its whole weight.</p>
        </blockquote>

        <p>
          Not just the praise. Not just the outcome you meant. Not just the slide that went well.
          You do not get to keep the cheers and discard the side-eye.
        </p>

        <p>
          If you do a thing,
          <strong>you own all the consequences</strong>
          , including the boring ones, the embarrassing ones, the expensive ones, and the ones that
          arrive years later wearing someone else’s face.
        </p>

        <h3>Corollary</h3>
        <p>If you are telling a story that removes discomfort, you are editing the evidence.</p>

        <h3>Marginal Note</h3>
        <p>
          This law exists to protect scribes, whistle-scratches, post-incident reports,
          uncomfortable appendices, and anyone told “that’s not relevant anymore.”

        <h2>Goblin Law #32 — "Never Patch a Monkey"</h2>

        <p>
          When goblins strap new tails onto old monkeys, the beast runs wild, stealing fruit and
          smashing pots. So it is with code: patching another’s functions makes the whole hall
          brittle.
        </p>

        <p>
          If a goblin must change a thing, they raise a
          <strong>new module</strong>
          with its own name and song, never disguising mischief as another’s work.
        </p>

        <h3>Corollary</h3>
        <ul>
          <li>Extend, don’t overwrite.</li>
          <li>Compose, don’t contort.</li>

        <h2>Goblin Law #37 — "Never Meddle in Another Goblin's Guts"</h2>

        <p>
          When one goblin module pokes about inside another’s squishy bits, chaos follows.
          Boundaries blur, secrets spill, and soon the whole den stinks of burnt mushrooms.
        </p>

        <p>
          Wise goblins use the Bus: speak your need, let the message travel, and let the other
          goblin respond in their own way.
        </p>

        <h3>Corollary</h3>
        <p>
          If goblins bypass the message system and meddle directly, it always ends in burnt
          mushrooms.

        <p>
          From the pit there comes but one count-in. The drummer’s quiet tap, the conductor’s nod —
          that is enough to set the hall in motion.
        </p>

        <p>
          Let not every goblin shout their own “ready,” for a dozen false starts tear the tune to

          alone beats the lifecycle drum.
